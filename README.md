# Application Form Scanner

The primary goal of the **Application Form Scanner** project is to leverage Document Intelligence (Azure AI service) for the development of a web application designed for BC Housing. This web application is capable of processing handwritten applications, including those for SAFER (Shelter Aid for Elderly Renters), and transforming them into digital versions. The project's objective is to streamline the documentation digitization process at BC Housing, reducing the manual effort required for converting handwritten applications into digital formats.
